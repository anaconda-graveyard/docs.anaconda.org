### Getting Started


#####Q. How do I get started with Binstar?

{% call section('Accounts') %}

###Accounts

#####Q. What kind of account do I have?

#####Q. How can I upgrade my account?

A. You can upgrade to a paid account [here](https://binstar.org/settings/billing).  This will allow you to create private packages and increase your storage limit.

#####Q. What is an organization? How is it different from an individual account?

A. An organization is a more robust account, which allows multiple individual users to administer packages and have more granular control of package access by other users.

###Packages


#####Q. What kind of packages does Binstar support?

Binstar supports conda and PyPI packages.


#####Q. Who can find and install my packages?

To enable private package uploading, you can [purchase a paid account](https://binstar.org/about/plans/).

{% endcall %}

{% call section('Channels') %}

###Channels

#####Q. What is a channel?

A. Channels are one way Binstar helps you control who can access your packages.  When you tag a package as belonging to a specific channel, only users who are listening to that channel will see the package and be able to install it.

By default, all packages you upload are sent to your `main` channel.  However, you could also have a `dev` channel that only your internal development team can access.  You can upload a package to the `dev` channel, allow other internal users to test it, and then promote it to the `main` channel when it is ready to be released.  You can find more information on channels [here](/channels.html).


{% endcall %}

{% call section('Tokens') %}

### Tokens

#####Q. What is a token?
A. A token is the mechanism by which you authenticate to the Binstar client.  In addition, you can generate new tokens to give other users specifically scoped access to packages and collections.  You can find more information on tokens [here](/token_gen.html).
